# GridBiz

This website is based on Brad Traversy's [Build a Responsive Grid CSS Website Layout From Scratch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moBhzSC455o) on YouTube.

The aim of the video is to teach you how to build website layouts with grid template areas as well as other modern CSS features and techniques (like CSS variables, rem units and flexbox).
